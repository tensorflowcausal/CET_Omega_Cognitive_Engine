# CET Ω Cognitive Engine
Modular–Informational Learning Architecture  
Author: Christian Balfagón (2025)

This repository contains the reference implementation and benchmark
skeleton for the CET Ω Cognitive Engine, a modular–informational
representational learning system based on an informational
coordinate ψ and structural attention A(z, ψ).

## Structure

- `engine/`
  - Core PyTorch implementation of the cognitive engine.
- `benchmarks/`
  - Example scripts for reconstruction, world-model prediction,
    and symmetry sensitivity experiments.
- `docs/`
  - High-level documentation and theoretical background.
